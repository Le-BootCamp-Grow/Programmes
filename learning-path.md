# Web developer bootcamp
## Learning Path to junior web developer

> Here's a learning path to take that covers key topics from entry-level to junior developer level. This revised learning path covers a wider range of topics and includes more project-based learning opportunities for our students. You can get the best out of our learning path by going carefully through the content and accomplishing all the projects involved. We recommend you to go through this one step at a time. We've created this to be for 12 weeks. However, you can spend more time. What matters is that you take your time to get the best out of this! Be free to ask questions and seek help when needed.
